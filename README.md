# Indian Sign Language Recognition System using LSTM and MediaPipe

A deep learning-based system for real-time Indian Sign Language (ISL) recognition using PyTorch, MediaPipe, and Attention-based LSTM.

## Project Overview

This project implements a real-time Indian Sign Language (ISL) recognition system using bidirectional LSTM neural networks and computer vision. The system captures video input through a webcam, extracts hand and pose landmarks using MediaPipe, and classifies signs using a bidirectional LSTM model with attention mechanism.

Key features:

- Real-time ISL recognition from webcam feed
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) output for recognized signs
- Attention-based bidirectional LSTM model for improved temporal pattern recognition
- User-friendly Streamlit interface
- Customizable confidence threshold

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher (as specified in `.python-version` file)
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for real-time performance)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for real-time performance)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AdityaT-19/ISL-LSTM.git
cd ISL-LSTM
```

2. Install dependencies using uv (Python environment manager)

```sh
# Install uv if you don't have it
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Create a virtual environment using the Python version from .python-version
uv venv

# Activate virtual environment (Windows)
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies using uv sync
uv sync

# Alternative: install in development mode
uv pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Running the Application

To start the Streamlit interface:

```sh
cd ui
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your default web browser.

### User Interface

- **Start Webcam**: Begin sign language detection
- **Stop Webcam**: Stop the detection process
- **Confidence Threshold**: Adjust the minimum confidence for predictions
- **Enable Text-to-Speech**: Toggle speech output for recognized signs

## System Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

1. **Feature Extraction**: MediaPipe Holistic model extracts 3D landmarks from:

   - Hand positions (left and right)
   - Upper body pose
   - Hand shape dynamics
   - Relative position features

2. **Model Architecture**:

   - ImprovedGestureLSTM with bidirectional layers
   - Self-attention mechanism for temporal feature refinement
   - Input dimension: 354 features
   - Hidden size: 128 units
   - 2 LSTM layers

3. **Feature Engineering**:

   - Base keypoints (162 features)
   - Velocity features (162 features)
   - Hand shape dynamics (4 features)
   - Additional features for dimensionality matching (26 features)

4. **Prediction Pipeline**:
   - Frame capture → MediaPipe processing → Feature extraction → Sequence buffering → Model prediction → Temporal smoothing → TTS (if enabled)

## Model Training

The model was trained using sequences of Indian Sign Language gestures captured with MediaPipe. The training process included:

- Data augmentation techniques:
  - Random noise addition
  - Spatial shifting
  - Time warping
- Feature normalization
- 5-fold cross-validation
- Training with Adam optimizer
- Learning rate scheduling
- Early stopping

Training details and code are available in the `notebooks/Improved_Model_Training.ipynb` notebook.

## Performance

The model achieves strong performance on the ISL test set:

- **Accuracy**: 94.8% on the test set
- **Loss**: Final training loss of 0.089, validation loss of 0.127
